project: 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

The src string is appended to the dest string by 0-strcat.c, which also adds an ending null byte after overwriting the dest string's terminating null byte (0). a pointer to the finished string dest is returned.
1-strncat.c The _strncat function is comparable to the _strcat function, but it only uses a maximum of n bytes from the source; also, if the source has n or more bytes, the source does not need to be null-terminated. Give back a pointer to the finished string dest.
The function 2-strncpy.c copies strings.

The function 3-strcmp.c compares two strings.
An integer array's contents can be reversed using the 4-rev array.c function.
The program 5-string toupper.c converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.
The function 6-cap string.c capitalizes each word in a string.
100-print number.c is a function that prints an integer. 7-leet.c is a function that encodes a string into 1337.
8-rot13.c is a function that encodes a string using rot13.
**101-magic.c: ** Pointers exercise
